# Todo List

## Done

- [x] Update the analysis script to use Chome-Har-Capturer's better console logging setup

## Todo

- [ ] Size chart height dynamically
- [ ] Set up SCSS modules
- [ ] Sorting by xhr doesn't work - remove pages which don't make xhr requests
- [ ] When sorting by a request type, that request type should show as the leftmost column in the stacked bar chart.

## Feature Ideas

- The ability to view all the pages within a specific path subdirectory.
- The ability to view all requests from all subdirectories at once.
- Average / median webpage transfer size plotted on x-axis.
- Chart plotting the number of requests per page.
- Chart plotting the time taken for each page to load.
- Option to filter the chart by all pages that are greater than a certain size.
- Chart including all the embeds used on all the pages.
- List of all the domains requests are made to, sorted by the number of requests made to each domain.
- Total website weight (all pages) plotted on a time series chart, updated weekly.
